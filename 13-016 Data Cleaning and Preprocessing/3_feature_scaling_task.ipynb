    "For the situation where you want to build a linear regression model to predict someone's grades based on how much time they spend on various activities during a typical school week, and you notice that the measurements for how much time students spend studying aren't normally distributed (with some students spending almost no time studying, while others study for four or more hours daily), normalization would be more appropriate. Normalization scales the values of a variable to a range between 0 and 1, preserving the relative differences in the data. This transformation ensures that the time spent studying is comparable to other variables in the regression model without biasing the model towards variables with larger scales.\n",

    "In this scenario, where you're incorporating information on how students perform on several fitness tests alongside their grades, and you observe that students perform far more jumping jacks than push-ups (with the average for the former being 40, and for the latter only 10), standardization would be more suitable. Standardization transforms the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, making it easier to compare variables with different units and scales. Since the number of jumping jacks and push-ups is measured in different units and has different average values, standardizing these variables would ensure that they contribute equally to the model without being dominated by variables with larger scales."
